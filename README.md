# How to reproduce the results?
Download the SPMF tool in your machine (URL: http://www.philippe-fournier-viger.com/spmf/index.php?link=download.php).
You must have JDK installed in your machine to run the tool.
You may refer to the URL : http://www.philippe-fournier-viger.com/spmf/how_to_run_graphical_interface.php. It explains how to use the tool.
Once you understand how to use the tool, open it. Select a sequential rule mining algorithm ( for example ERMiner, RulesGrowth) from the first drop-down menu in the tool.
Now download the datasets from our repository (URL: https://github.com/ConEModel/SequentialRuleMiningDataSets).
Next, specify an input file in the tool by selecting any one of the datasets downloaded in the previous step.
Specify an output file.
Now specify a minimum support and minimum confidence value for your results and click on "Run Algorithm" option in the tool.
You will observe that the output is generated in the specified output file.
